#	termcap syntax
#
# The entries in this file have been so thoroughly orphaned by time and
# circumstance that I have elected to remove them from the terminfo termcap.
#
# In most cases, this is because the entries (and any associated comments)
# seem to hold out no hope that the target terminal will ever be identified
# (and I've tried, on comp.terminals, for each of these, many times).
#
# In a few cases, these are custom or homebrew designs that have obviously
# been obsolete for more than a decade.
#
# Entries for obsolete hardware with less than a 80x24 screen size 
# have also been gathered here.  This includes daisy-wheel printers.
#
# Finally, entries that were in the main file classically but don't appear to
# convey any information have been gathered here.  Many of these have the
# -na suffix.
#
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.
#
# See the terminfo master change log for change history.

#### Amstrad

# Russell Marks <rus@forfree.at> writes on 10 Jul 1999 21:40:52:
# ZCN, my CP/M-like OS for the Amstrad NC100, uses a terminal emulation
# on its console that might be generously called `unique', not least
# because it doesn't actually emulate anything. :-)
#
# The Amstrad NC100 was an A4-sized Z80 portable produced in the early
# 1990s (from roughly 1992 to 1994 I think), and was touted as a `user
# friendly' machine (it was advertised on TV as such). It wasn't exactly
# a great success, though Amstrad produced a followup `NC200', so
# presumably it didn't flop *that* badly.
#
# ZCN is, of course, not at all user-friendly. :-) (To be fair I
# recently wrote a graphical front-end for it, but it's still CP/M-ish
# at heart.) I wrote it mainly because I liked the idea of a portable
# CP/M box, but also because I was rather annoyed at how inextensible
# and limiting the built-in software was. I uploaded ZCN 0.1 in 1994;
# [1.2 came out in mid-1999].
# As for live/dead/OOTB status, Amstrad seem to be OOTB (the 8-bit
# computer business, that is), and I *think* the company as a whole may
# now be dead, but I'm not sure. They released a 16MHz Z80-based `PcW16'
# [sic] a couple of years ago which (AIUI) was rather like a desktop
# version of the NC200 (it was incompatible with their previous
# CP/M-based PCW/PcW machines), but I'm pretty sure that was the last
# one. Arnor, who wrote the NC100's ROM software - which was largely
# built around a hacked-up copy of Protext - are dead. I'd say ZCN
# itself is live - I still hack on it from time to time, and still use
# my ZCN box on a daily basis (if only for minor stuff like noting
# things down).
# 
# Anyway, the control codes used by the ZCN console evolved in a pretty
# ad-hoc manner, as is probably obvious from looking at them. For some
# reason I was (in 1994) rather taken with the idea that all the codes
# should be single-character ones, but didn't see the point in emulating
# an existing terminal like an ADM3A, and the rest is history. Sigh. :-)
# 
# In terms of popularity, it's a fair bet that ZCN is about as obscure
# as they come. (This is the main reason I've not sent an entry before;
# for all I know, I may be the only person anywhere using the ZCN
# console as a terminal!) I've only had correspondence from something
# like 5 or 6 people about ZCN, and only one of those was about using
# ZCN as a terminal.
# 
# Probably the only interesting feature about the ZCN console itself is
# the unusual screen size - 480x64 in pixels, meaning 120x10 in the 4x6
# chars ZCN uses. Oh, and also the NC100's keyboard is somewhat
# notorious for having a few brightly-coloured keys, which the ROM apps
# refer to (e.g. "To use the WORD PROCESSOR  Press YELLOW & RED") - the
# `Function' modifier key is yellow, cursor-left red, cursor-right
# green, and cursor-down blue.
# 
# A few other random keyboard notes, while I'm at it. There's a `Menu'
# key, but since the keyboard has no backquote key, ZCN uses it for
# that. There are three modifier keys (apart from shift) - Function,
# Control, and Symbol. ZCN uses Function, which is at the bottom-left of
# the keyboard, as an extra control key (the real Control is absurd,
# being normal-key-sized and below `Z'), and Symbol as Meta.

# This is a termcap for the VT100 emulator that comes with the 1670
# modem, for the Commodore 128. It does insert-character and
# delete-character. However, to get the insert-character, you must use
# alt-* to remap control-A on receive into the INSERT character
# (shift-DEL). Just type <alt-*>r<control-a><shift-DEL>. Makes use of
# the fact that the people who implemented this wacky emulator are just
# printing characters to the default display driver, and fetching
# characters from default input (the reason you can't produce a
# control-t to do the "twiddle" command in Emacs).

# Very similar to the IBM 3101 termcap.  Escape-D used for backspace because

# and cursor addressing sends a tab for row/column 9.  What a losing terminal!

# The entries in this file have been so thoroughly orphaned by time and
# circumstance that I have elected to remove them from the terminfo termcap.
#
# In most cases, this is because the entries (and any associated comments)
# seem to hold out no hope that the target terminal will ever be identified
# (and I've tried, on comp.terminals, for each of these, many times).
#
# In a few cases, these are custom or homebrew designs that have obviously
# been obsolete for more than a decade.
#
# Entries for obsolete hardware with less than a 80x24 screen size 
# have also been gathered here.  This includes daisy-wheel printers.
#
# Finally, entries that were in the main file classically but don't appear to
# convey any information have been gathered here.  Many of these have the
# -na suffix.
#
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.

#### Amstrad
#

# Russell Marks <rus@forfree.at> writes on 10 Jul 1999 21:40:52:
# ZCN, my CP/M-like OS for the Amstrad NC100, uses a terminal emulation
# on its console that might be generously called `unique', not least
# because it doesn't actually emulate anything. :-)
#
# The Amstrad NC100 was an A4-sized Z80 portable produced in the early
# 1990s (from roughly 1992 to 1994 I think), and was touted as a `user
# friendly' machine (it was advertised on TV as such). It wasn't exactly
# a great success, though Amstrad produced a followup `NC200', so
# presumably it didn't flop *that* badly.
#
# ZCN is, of course, not at all user-friendly. :-) (To be fair I
# recently wrote a graphical front-end for it, but it's still CP/M-ish
# at heart.) I wrote it mainly because I liked the idea of a portable
# CP/M box, but also because I was rather annoyed at how inextensible
# and limiting the built-in software was. I uploaded ZCN 0.1 in 1994;
# [1.2 came out in mid-1999].
# As for live/dead/OOTB status, Amstrad seem to be OOTB (the 8-bit
# computer business, that is), and I *think* the company as a whole may
# now be dead, but I'm not sure. They released a 16MHz Z80-based `PcW16'
# [sic] a couple of years ago which (AIUI) was rather like a desktop
# version of the NC200 (it was incompatible with their previous
# CP/M-based PCW/PcW machines), but I'm pretty sure that was the last
# one. Arnor, who wrote the NC100's ROM software - which was largely
# built around a hacked-up copy of Protext - are dead. I'd say ZCN
# itself is live - I still hack on it from time to time, and still use
# my ZCN box on a daily basis (if only for minor stuff like noting
# things down).
# 
# Anyway, the control codes used by the ZCN console evolved in a pretty
# ad-hoc manner, as is probably obvious from looking at them. For some
# reason I was (in 1994) rather taken with the idea that all the codes
# should be single-character ones, but didn't see the point in emulating
# an existing terminal like an ADM3A, and the rest is history. Sigh. :-)
# 
# In terms of popularity, it's a fair bet that ZCN is about as obscure
# as they come. (This is the main reason I've not sent an entry before;
# for all I know, I may be the only person anywhere using the ZCN
# console as a terminal!) I've only had correspondence from something
# like 5 or 6 people about ZCN, and only one of those was about using
# ZCN as a terminal.
# 
# Probably the only interesting feature about the ZCN console itself is
# the unusual screen size - 480x64 in pixels, meaning 120x10 in the 4x6
# chars ZCN uses. Oh, and also the NC100's keyboard is somewhat
# notorious for having a few brightly-coloured keys, which the ROM apps
# refer to (e.g. "To use the WORD PROCESSOR  Press YELLOW & RED") - the
# `Function' modifier key is yellow, cursor-left red, cursor-right
# green, and cursor-down blue.
# 
# A few other random keyboard notes, while I'm at it. There's a `Menu'
# key, but since the keyboard has no backquote key, ZCN uses it for
# that. There are three modifier keys (apart from shift) - Function,
# Control, and Symbol. ZCN uses Function, which is at the bottom-left of
# the keyboard, as an extra control key (the real Control is absurd,
# being normal-key-sized and below `Z'), and Symbol as Meta.

# Commodore 128/1670 vt100 emulator from BRL

# This is a termcap for the VT100 emulator that comes with the 1670
# modem, for the Commodore 128. It does insert-character and
# delete-character. However, to get the insert-character, you must use
# alt-* to remap control-A on receive into the INSERT character
# (shift-DEL). Just type <alt-*>r<control-a><shift-DEL>. Makes use of
# the fact that the people who implemented this wacky emulator are just
# printing characters to the default display driver, and fetching
# characters from default input (the reason you can't produce a
# control-t to do the "twiddle" command in Emacs).

# I truly hope that I'm not the only person left on earth that knows this

# condition.
# 
# The Xitex SCT-100 was a single-card terminal kit (supply your own
# keyboard and video monitor), available either with or without all the
# required components.  It came with a very nice assembly and operations
# manual.  It offered a resolution of 64 by 16 characters, and handled
# ASCII at 110 or 300 baud and Baudot at 45.45 or 74.2 baud over RS-232,
# 20 mA or 60 mA current loop.
#
# My manual (Copyright 1977) lists the manufacturer as Xitex Corp, 13628
# Neutron, P.O. Box 402110, Dallas, Texas, 75240.  Phone (214) 386-3859.
# 
# I remember this terminal fondly, because I used it (briefly) on the
# first real computer I built:  a Z-80 CP/M machine.  I even got my
# favorite full-screen editor to run on it, though it was a bit comical at
# 300 baud.

# From: Joel Rubin <jmrubin@coral.berkeley.edu>
# This is a preliminary TERMCAP for VIDTEX, a terminal program sold by 
# Compuserve.  Line and column numbers are computer-dependent (I have a
# Commodore '64); you should use the meta-B option to shut off clean-breaking
# of lines.  No key codes included since some of them are programmable and
# most are machine-specific.  Works on vi if you don't use clean-breaking.
# Very similar to the IBM 3101 termcap.  Escape-D used for backspace because
# control-H is destructive backspace.  There seem to be a few weirdnesses
# (especially at the beginning of a wrapped line), and the cursor does not,
# unfortunately, flash.

# The entries in this file have been so thoroughly orphaned by time and
# circumstance that I have elected to remove them from the terminfo termcap.
#
# In most cases, this is because the entries (and any associated comments)
# seem to hold out no hope that the target terminal will ever be identified
# (and I've tried, on comp.terminals, for each of these, many times).
#
# In a few cases, these are custom or homebrew designs that have obviously
# been obsolete for more than a decade.
#
# Entries for obsolete hardware with less than a 80x24 screen size 
# have also been gathered here.  This includes daisy-wheel printers.
#
# Finally, entries that were in the main file classically but don't appear to
# convey any information have been gathered here.  Many of these have the
# -na suffix.
#
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more

#### Amstrad
#

# Russell Marks <rus@forfree.at> writes on 10 Jul 1999 21:40:52:
# ZCN, my CP/M-like OS for the Amstrad NC100, uses a terminal emulation
# on its console that might be generously called `unique', not least
# because it doesn't actually emulate anything. :-)
#
# The Amstrad NC100 was an A4-sized Z80 portable produced in the early
# 1990s (from roughly 1992 to 1994 I think), and was touted as a `user
# friendly' machine (it was advertised on TV as such). It wasn't exactly
# a great success, though Amstrad produced a followup `NC200', so
# presumably it didn't flop *that* badly.
#
# ZCN is, of course, not at all user-friendly. :-) (To be fair I
# recently wrote a graphical front-end for it, but it's still CP/M-ish
# at heart.) I wrote it mainly because I liked the idea of a portable
# CP/M box, but also because I was rather annoyed at how inextensible
# and limiting the built-in software was. I uploaded ZCN 0.1 in 1994;
# [1.2 came out in mid-1999].
# As for live/dead/OOTB status, Amstrad seem to be OOTB (the 8-bit
# computer business, that is), and I *think* the company as a whole may
# now be dead, but I'm not sure. They released a 16MHz Z80-based `PcW16'
# [sic] a couple of years ago which (AIUI) was rather like a desktop
# version of the NC200 (it was incompatible with their previous
# CP/M-based PCW/PcW machines), but I'm pretty sure that was the last
# one. Arnor, who wrote the NC100's ROM software - which was largely
# built around a hacked-up copy of Protext - are dead. I'd say ZCN
# itself is live - I still hack on it from time to time, and still use
# my ZCN box on a daily basis (if only for minor stuff like noting
# things down).
# 
# Anyway, the control codes used by the ZCN console evolved in a pretty
# ad-hoc manner, as is probably obvious from looking at them. For some
# reason I was (in 1994) rather taken with the idea that all the codes
# should be single-character ones, but didn't see the point in emulating
# an existing terminal like an ADM3A, and the rest is history. Sigh. :-)
# 
# In terms of popularity, it's a fair bet that ZCN is about as obscure
# as they come. (This is the main reason I've not sent an entry before;
# for all I know, I may be the only person anywhere using the ZCN
# console as a terminal!) I've only had correspondence from something
# like 5 or 6 people about ZCN, and only one of those was about using
# ZCN as a terminal.
# 
# Probably the only interesting feature about the ZCN console itself is
# the unusual screen size - 480x64 in pixels, meaning 120x10 in the 4x6
# chars ZCN uses. Oh, and also the NC100's keyboard is somewhat
# notorious for having a few brightly-coloured keys, which the ROM apps
# refer to (e.g. "To use the WORD PROCESSOR  Press YELLOW & RED") - the
# `Function' modifier key is yellow, cursor-left red, cursor-right
# green, and cursor-down blue.
# 
# A few other random keyboard notes, while I'm at it. There's a `Menu'
# key, but since the keyboard has no backquote key, ZCN uses it for
# that. There are three modifier keys (apart from shift) - Function,
# Control, and Symbol. ZCN uses Function, which is at the bottom-left of
# the keyboard, as an extra control key (the real Control is absurd,
# being normal-key-sized and below `Z'), and Symbol as Meta.

# alt-* to remap control-A on receive into the INSERT character

# David Querbach <querbach@stargate.ca> tells us:
#
# I truly hope that I'm not the only person left on earth that knows this
# terminal.  I may, however, be the only one who still has one in working
# condition.
# 
# The Xitex SCT-100 was a single-card terminal kit (supply your own
# keyboard and video monitor), available either with or without all the
# required components.  It came with a very nice assembly and operations
# manual.  It offered a resolution of 64 by 16 characters, and handled
# ASCII at 110 or 300 baud and Baudot at 45.45 or 74.2 baud over RS-232,
# 20 mA or 60 mA current loop.
#
# My manual (Copyright 1977) lists the manufacturer as Xitex Corp, 13628
# Neutron, P.O. Box 402110, Dallas, Texas, 75240.  Phone (214) 386-3859.
# 
# I remember this terminal fondly, because I used it (briefly) on the
# first real computer I built:  a Z-80 CP/M machine.  I even got my
# favorite full-screen editor to run on it, though it was a bit comical at
# 300 baud.

# From: Joel Rubin <jmrubin@coral.berkeley.edu>
# This is a preliminary TERMCAP for VIDTEX, a terminal program sold by 
# Compuserve.  Line and column numbers are computer-dependent (I have a
# Commodore '64); you should use the meta-B option to shut off clean-breaking
# of lines.  No key codes included since some of them are programmable and
# most are machine-specific.  Works on vi if you don't use clean-breaking.
# Very similar to the IBM 3101 termcap.  Escape-D used for backspace because
# control-H is destructive backspace.  There seem to be a few weirdnesses
# (especially at the beginning of a wrapped line), and the cursor does not,
# unfortunately, flash.

# The entries in this file have been so thoroughly orphaned by time and
# circumstance that I have elected to remove them from the terminfo termcap.
#
# In most cases, this is because the entries (and any associated comments)
# seem to hold out no hope that the target terminal will ever be identified
# (and I've tried, on comp.terminals, for each of these, many times).
#
# In a few cases, these are custom or homebrew designs that have obviously
# been obsolete for more than a decade.
#
# Entries for obsolete hardware with less than a 80x24 screen size 
# have also been gathered here.  This includes daisy-wheel printers.
#
# Finally, entries that were in the main file classically but don't appear to
# convey any information have been gathered here.  Many of these have the
# -na suffix.
#
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more

#### Amstrad
#

# Russell Marks <rus@forfree.at> writes on 10 Jul 1999 21:40:52:
# ZCN, my CP/M-like OS for the Amstrad NC100, uses a terminal emulation
# on its console that might be generously called `unique', not least
# because it doesn't actually emulate anything. :-)
#
# The Amstrad NC100 was an A4-sized Z80 portable produced in the early
# 1990s (from roughly 1992 to 1994 I think), and was touted as a `user
# friendly' machine (it was advertised on TV as such). It wasn't exactly
# a great success, though Amstrad produced a followup `NC200', so
# presumably it didn't flop *that* badly.
#
# ZCN is, of course, not at all user-friendly. :-) (To be fair I
# recently wrote a graphical front-end for it, but it's still CP/M-ish
# at heart.) I wrote it mainly because I liked the idea of a portable
# CP/M box, but also because I was rather annoyed at how inextensible
# and limiting the built-in software was. I uploaded ZCN 0.1 in 1994;
# [1.2 came out in mid-1999].
# As for live/dead/OOTB status, Amstrad seem to be OOTB (the 8-bit
# computer business, that is), and I *think* the company as a whole may
# now be dead, but I'm not sure. They released a 16MHz Z80-based `PcW16'
# [sic] a couple of years ago which (AIUI) was rather like a desktop
# version of the NC200 (it was incompatible with their previous
# CP/M-based PCW/PcW machines), but I'm pretty sure that was the last
# one. Arnor, who wrote the NC100's ROM software - which was largely
# built around a hacked-up copy of Protext - are dead. I'd say ZCN
# itself is live - I still hack on it from time to time, and still use
# my ZCN box on a daily basis (if only for minor stuff like noting
# things down).
# 
# Anyway, the control codes used by the ZCN console evolved in a pretty
# ad-hoc manner, as is probably obvious from looking at them. For some
# reason I was (in 1994) rather taken with the idea that all the codes
# should be single-character ones, but didn't see the point in emulating
# an existing terminal like an ADM3A, and the rest is history. Sigh. :-)
# 
# In terms of popularity, it's a fair bet that ZCN is about as obscure
# as they come. (This is the main reason I've not sent an entry before;
# for all I know, I may be the only person anywhere using the ZCN
# console as a terminal!) I've only had correspondence from something
# like 5 or 6 people about ZCN, and only one of those was about using
# ZCN as a terminal.
# 
# Probably the only interesting feature about the ZCN console itself is
# the unusual screen size - 480x64 in pixels, meaning 120x10 in the 4x6
# chars ZCN uses. Oh, and also the NC100's keyboard is somewhat
# notorious for having a few brightly-coloured keys, which the ROM apps
# refer to (e.g. "To use the WORD PROCESSOR  Press YELLOW & RED") - the
# `Function' modifier key is yellow, cursor-left red, cursor-right
# green, and cursor-down blue.
# 
# A few other random keyboard notes, while I'm at it. There's a `Menu'
# key, but since the keyboard has no backquote key, ZCN uses it for
# that. There are three modifier keys (apart from shift) - Function,
# Control, and Symbol. ZCN uses Function, which is at the bottom-left of
# the keyboard, as an extra control key (the real Control is absurd,
# being normal-key-sized and below `Z'), and Symbol as Meta.

# This is a termcap for the VT100 emulator that comes with the 1670
# modem, for the Commodore 128. It does insert-character and
# delete-character. However, to get the insert-character, you must use
# alt-* to remap control-A on receive into the INSERT character
# (shift-DEL). Just type <alt-*>r<control-a><shift-DEL>. Makes use of
# the fact that the people who implemented this wacky emulator are just
# printing characters to the default display driver, and fetching
# characters from default input (the reason you can't produce a

# David Querbach <querbach@stargate.ca> tells us:
#
# I truly hope that I'm not the only person left on earth that knows this
# terminal.  I may, however, be the only one who still has one in working
# condition.
# 
# The Xitex SCT-100 was a single-card terminal kit (supply your own
# keyboard and video monitor), available either with or without all the
# required components.  It came with a very nice assembly and operations
# manual.  It offered a resolution of 64 by 16 characters, and handled
# ASCII at 110 or 300 baud and Baudot at 45.45 or 74.2 baud over RS-232,
# 20 mA or 60 mA current loop.
#
# My manual (Copyright 1977) lists the manufacturer as Xitex Corp, 13628
# Neutron, P.O. Box 402110, Dallas, Texas, 75240.  Phone (214) 386-3859.
# 
# I remember this terminal fondly, because I used it (briefly) on the
# first real computer I built:  a Z-80 CP/M machine.  I even got my
# favorite full-screen editor to run on it, though it was a bit comical at
# 300 baud.

# From: Joel Rubin <jmrubin@coral.berkeley.edu>
# This is a preliminary TERMCAP for VIDTEX, a terminal program sold by 
# Compuserve.  Line and column numbers are computer-dependent (I have a
# Commodore '64); you should use the meta-B option to shut off clean-breaking
# of lines.  No key codes included since some of them are programmable and
# most are machine-specific.  Works on vi if you don't use clean-breaking.
# Very similar to the IBM 3101 termcap.  Escape-D used for backspace because
# control-H is destructive backspace.  There seem to be a few weirdnesses
# (especially at the beginning of a wrapped line), and the cursor does not,
# unfortunately, flash.

# The entries in this file have been so thoroughly orphaned by time and
# circumstance that I have elected to remove them from the terminfo termcap.
#
# In most cases, this is because the entries (and any associated comments)
# seem to hold out no hope that the target terminal will ever be identified
# (and I've tried, on comp.terminals, for each of these, many times).
#
# In a few cases, these are custom or homebrew designs that have obviously
# been obsolete for more than a decade.
#
# Entries for obsolete hardware with less than a 80x24 screen size 
# have also been gathered here.  This includes daisy-wheel printers.
#
# Finally, entries that were in the main file classically but don't appear to
# convey any information have been gathered here.  Many of these have the
# -na suffix.
#
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.

#### Amstrad
#

# Russell Marks <rus@forfree.at> writes on 10 Jul 1999 21:40:52:
# ZCN, my CP/M-like OS for the Amstrad NC100, uses a terminal emulation
# on its console that might be generously called `unique', not least
# because it doesn't actually emulate anything. :-)
#
# The Amstrad NC100 was an A4-sized Z80 portable produced in the early
# 1990s (from roughly 1992 to 1994 I think), and was touted as a `user
# friendly' machine (it was advertised on TV as such). It wasn't exactly
# a great success, though Amstrad produced a followup `NC200', so
# presumably it didn't flop *that* badly.
#
# ZCN is, of course, not at all user-friendly. :-) (To be fair I
# recently wrote a graphical front-end for it, but it's still CP/M-ish
# at heart.) I wrote it mainly because I liked the idea of a portable
# CP/M box, but also because I was rather annoyed at how inextensible
# and limiting the built-in software was. I uploaded ZCN 0.1 in 1994;
# [1.2 came out in mid-1999].
# As for live/dead/OOTB status, Amstrad seem to be OOTB (the 8-bit
# computer business, that is), and I *think* the company as a whole may
# now be dead, but I'm not sure. They released a 16MHz Z80-based `PcW16'
# [sic] a couple of years ago which (AIUI) was rather like a desktop
# version of the NC200 (it was incompatible with their previous
# CP/M-based PCW/PcW machines), but I'm pretty sure that was the last
# one. Arnor, who wrote the NC100's ROM software - which was largely
# built around a hacked-up copy of Protext - are dead. I'd say ZCN
# itself is live - I still hack on it from time to time, and still use
# my ZCN box on a daily basis (if only for minor stuff like noting
# things down).
# 
# Anyway, the control codes used by the ZCN console evolved in a pretty
# ad-hoc manner, as is probably obvious from looking at them. For some
# reason I was (in 1994) rather taken with the idea that all the codes
# should be single-character ones, but didn't see the point in emulating
# an existing terminal like an ADM3A, and the rest is history. Sigh. :-)
# 
# In terms of popularity, it's a fair bet that ZCN is about as obscure
# as they come. (This is the main reason I've not sent an entry before;
# for all I know, I may be the only person anywhere using the ZCN
# console as a terminal!) I've only had correspondence from something
# like 5 or 6 people about ZCN, and only one of those was about using
# ZCN as a terminal.
# 
# Probably the only interesting feature about the ZCN console itself is
# the unusual screen size - 480x64 in pixels, meaning 120x10 in the 4x6
# chars ZCN uses. Oh, and also the NC100's keyboard is somewhat
# notorious for having a few brightly-coloured keys, which the ROM apps
# refer to (e.g. "To use the WORD PROCESSOR  Press YELLOW & RED") - the
# `Function' modifier key is yellow, cursor-left red, cursor-right
# green, and cursor-down blue.
# 
# A few other random keyboard notes, while I'm at it. There's a `Menu'
# key, but since the keyboard has no backquote key, ZCN uses it for
# that. There are three modifier keys (apart from shift) - Function,
# Control, and Symbol. ZCN uses Function, which is at the bottom-left of
# the keyboard, as an extra control key (the real Control is absurd,
# being normal-key-sized and below `Z'), and Symbol as Meta.

# This is a termcap for the VT100 emulator that comes with the 1670
# modem, for the Commodore 128. It does insert-character and
# delete-character. However, to get the insert-character, you must use
# alt-* to remap control-A on receive into the INSERT character
# (shift-DEL). Just type <alt-*>r<control-a><shift-DEL>. Makes use of
# the fact that the people who implemented this wacky emulator are just
# printing characters to the default display driver, and fetching
# characters from default input (the reason you can't produce a
# control-t to do the "twiddle" command in Emacs).

# David Querbach <querbach@stargate.ca> tells us:
#
# I truly hope that I'm not the only person left on earth that knows this
# terminal.  I may, however, be the only one who still has one in working
# condition.
# 
# The Xitex SCT-100 was a single-card terminal kit (supply your own
# keyboard and video monitor), available either with or without all the
# required components.  It came with a very nice assembly and operations
# manual.  It offered a resolution of 64 by 16 characters, and handled
# ASCII at 110 or 300 baud and Baudot at 45.45 or 74.2 baud over RS-232,
# 20 mA or 60 mA current loop.
#
# My manual (Copyright 1977) lists the manufacturer as Xitex Corp, 13628
# Neutron, P.O. Box 402110, Dallas, Texas, 75240.  Phone (214) 386-3859.
# 
# I remember this terminal fondly, because I used it (briefly) on the
# first real computer I built:  a Z-80 CP/M machine.  I even got my
# favorite full-screen editor to run on it, though it was a bit comical at
# 300 baud.

# From: Joel Rubin <jmrubin@coral.berkeley.edu>
# This is a preliminary TERMCAP for VIDTEX, a terminal program sold by 
# Compuserve.  Line and column numbers are computer-dependent (I have a
# Commodore '64); you should use the meta-B option to shut off clean-breaking
# of lines.  No key codes included since some of them are programmable and
# most are machine-specific.  Works on vi if you don't use clean-breaking.
# Very similar to the IBM 3101 termcap.  Escape-D used for backspace because
# control-H is destructive backspace.  There seem to be a few weirdnesses
# (especially at the beginning of a wrapped line), and the cursor does not,
# unfortunately, flash.

#
# The entries in this file have been so thoroughly orphaned by time and
# circumstance that I have elected to remove them from the terminfo termcap.
#
# In most cases, this is because the entries (and any associated comments)
# seem to hold out no hope that the target terminal will ever be identified
# (and I've tried, on comp.terminals, for each of these, many times).
#
# In a few cases, these are custom or homebrew designs that have obviously
# been obsolete for more than a decade.
#
# Entries for obsolete hardware with less than a 80x24 screen size 
# have also been gathered here.  This includes daisy-wheel printers.
#
# Finally, entries that were in the main file classically but don't appear to
# convey any information have been gathered here.  Many of these have the
# -na suffix.
#
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more
#
# to see a listing of section headings.

#### Amstrad

# Russell Marks <rus@forfree.at> writes on 10 Jul 1999 21:40:52:
# ZCN, my CP/M-like OS for the Amstrad NC100, uses a terminal emulation
# on its console that might be generously called `unique', not least
# because it doesn't actually emulate anything. :-)
#
# The Amstrad NC100 was an A4-sized Z80 portable produced in the early
# 1990s (from roughly 1992 to 1994 I think), and was touted as a `user
# friendly' machine (it was advertised on TV as such). It wasn't exactly
# a great success, though Amstrad produced a followup `NC200', so
# presumably it didn't flop *that* badly.
#
# ZCN is, of course, not at all user-friendly. :-) (To be fair I
# recently wrote a graphical front-end for it, but it's still CP/M-ish
# at heart.) I wrote it mainly because I liked the idea of a portable
# CP/M box, but also because I was rather annoyed at how inextensible
# and limiting the built-in software was. I uploaded ZCN 0.1 in 1994;
# [1.2 came out in mid-1999].
# As for live/dead/OOTB status, Amstrad seem to be OOTB (the 8-bit
# computer business, that is), and I *think* the company as a whole may
# now be dead, but I'm not sure. They released a 16MHz Z80-based `PcW16'
# [sic] a couple of years ago which (AIUI) was rather like a desktop
# version of the NC200 (it was incompatible with their previous
# CP/M-based PCW/PcW machines), but I'm pretty sure that was the last
# one. Arnor, who wrote the NC100's ROM software - which was largely
# built around a hacked-up copy of Protext - are dead. I'd say ZCN
# itself is live - I still hack on it from time to time, and still use
# my ZCN box on a daily basis (if only for minor stuff like noting
# things down).
# 
# Anyway, the control codes used by the ZCN console evolved in a pretty
# ad-hoc manner, as is probably obvious from looking at them. For some
# reason I was (in 1994) rather taken with the idea that all the codes
# should be single-character ones, but didn't see the point in emulating
# an existing terminal like an ADM3A, and the rest is history. Sigh. :-)
# 
# In terms of popularity, it's a fair bet that ZCN is about as obscure
# as they come. (This is the main reason I've not sent an entry before;
# for all I know, I may be the only person anywhere using the ZCN
# console as a terminal!) I've only had correspondence from something
# like 5 or 6 people about ZCN, and only one of those was about using
# ZCN as a terminal.
# 
# Probably the only interesting feature about the ZCN console itself is
# the unusual screen size - 480x64 in pixels, meaning 120x10 in the 4x6
# chars ZCN uses. Oh, and also the NC100's keyboard is somewhat
# notorious for having a few brightly-coloured keys, which the ROM apps
# refer to (e.g. "To use the WORD PROCESSOR  Press YELLOW & RED") - the
# `Function' modifier key is yellow, cursor-left red, cursor-right
# green, and cursor-down blue.
# 
# A few other random keyboard notes, while I'm at it. There's a `Menu'
# key, but since the keyboard has no backquote key, ZCN uses it for
# that. There are three modifier keys (apart from shift) - Function,
# Control, and Symbol. ZCN uses Function, which is at the bottom-left of
# the keyboard, as an extra control key (the real Control is absurd,
# being normal-key-sized and below `Z'), and Symbol as Meta.

# This is a termcap for the VT100 emulator that comes with the 1670
# modem, for the Commodore 128. It does insert-character and
# delete-character. However, to get the insert-character, you must use
# alt-* to remap control-A on receive into the INSERT character
# (shift-DEL). Just type <alt-*>r<control-a><shift-DEL>. Makes use of
# the fact that the people who implemented this wacky emulator are just
# printing characters to the default display driver, and fetching
# characters from default input (the reason you can't produce a
# control-t to do the "twiddle" command in Emacs).

# Commodore '64); you should use the meta-B option to shut off clean-breaking
# of lines.  No key codes included since some of them are programmable and
# most are machine-specific.  Works on vi if you don't use clean-breaking.
# Very similar to the IBM 3101 termcap.  Escape-D used for backspace because
# control-H is destructive backspace.  There seem to be a few weirdnesses
# (especially at the beginning of a wrapped line), and the cursor does not,
# unfortunately, flash.
# (vid: changed :bc: to :le: -- esr)
# (vid: hmm...looks a lot like an incomplete description of a vt52)

#### Terak console
#
# Terak made a PDP-11 based machine with a bitmapped display that ran UCSD
# Pascal or RT11/85 as the native OS. It was quite a nice box for its day
# (1979 to 1985), and there were several running UCSD Pascal at UC Berkeley.
# There's a Terak Museum on WWW at <http://www.threedee.com/terak>.

# The entries in this file have been so thoroughly orphaned by time and
# circumstance that I have elected to remove them from the terminfo termcap.
#
# In most cases, this is because the entries (and any associated comments)
# seem to hold out no hope that the target terminal will ever be identified
# (and I've tried, on comp.terminals, for each of these, many times).
#
# In a few cases, these are custom or homebrew designs that have obviously
# been obsolete for more than a decade.
#
# Entries for obsolete hardware with less than a 80x24 screen size 
# have also been gathered here.  This includes daisy-wheel printers.
#
# Finally, entries that were in the main file classically but don't appear to
# convey any information have been gathered here.  Many of these have the
# -na suffix.
#
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with

#### Amstrad
#

# Russell Marks <rus@forfree.at> writes on 10 Jul 1999 21:40:52:
# ZCN, my CP/M-like OS for the Amstrad NC100, uses a terminal emulation
# on its console that might be generously called `unique', not least
# because it doesn't actually emulate anything. :-)
#
# The Amstrad NC100 was an A4-sized Z80 portable produced in the early
# 1990s (from roughly 1992 to 1994 I think), and was touted as a `user
# friendly' machine (it was advertised on TV as such). It wasn't exactly
# a great success, though Amstrad produced a followup `NC200', so
# presumably it didn't flop *that* badly.
#
# ZCN is, of course, not at all user-friendly. :-) (To be fair I
# recently wrote a graphical front-end for it, but it's still CP/M-ish
# at heart.) I wrote it mainly because I liked the idea of a portable
# CP/M box, but also because I was rather annoyed at how inextensible
# and limiting the built-in software was. I uploaded ZCN 0.1 in 1994;
# [1.2 came out in mid-1999].
# As for live/dead/OOTB status, Amstrad seem to be OOTB (the 8-bit
# computer business, that is), and I *think* the company as a whole may
# now be dead, but I'm not sure. They released a 16MHz Z80-based `PcW16'
# [sic] a couple of years ago which (AIUI) was rather like a desktop
# version of the NC200 (it was incompatible with their previous
# CP/M-based PCW/PcW machines), but I'm pretty sure that was the last
# one. Arnor, who wrote the NC100's ROM software - which was largely
# built around a hacked-up copy of Protext - are dead. I'd say ZCN
# itself is live - I still hack on it from time to time, and still use
# my ZCN box on a daily basis (if only for minor stuff like noting
# things down).
# 
# Anyway, the control codes used by the ZCN console evolved in a pretty
# ad-hoc manner, as is probably obvious from looking at them. For some
# reason I was (in 1994) rather taken with the idea that all the codes
# should be single-character ones, but didn't see the point in emulating
# an existing terminal like an ADM3A, and the rest is history. Sigh. :-)
# 
# In terms of popularity, it's a fair bet that ZCN is about as obscure
# as they come. (This is the main reason I've not sent an entry before;
# for all I know, I may be the only person anywhere using the ZCN
# console as a terminal!) I've only had correspondence from something
# like 5 or 6 people about ZCN, and only one of those was about using
# ZCN as a terminal.
# 
# Probably the only interesting feature about the ZCN console itself is
# the unusual screen size - 480x64 in pixels, meaning 120x10 in the 4x6
# chars ZCN uses. Oh, and also the NC100's keyboard is somewhat
# notorious for having a few brightly-coloured keys, which the ROM apps
# refer to (e.g. "To use the WORD PROCESSOR  Press YELLOW & RED") - the
# `Function' modifier key is yellow, cursor-left red, cursor-right
# green, and cursor-down blue.
#

# Commodore 128/1670 vt100 emulator from BRL

# This is a termcap for the VT100 emulator that comes with the 1670
# modem, for the Commodore 128. It does insert-character and
# delete-character. However, to get the insert-character, you must use
# alt-* to remap control-A on receive into the INSERT character
# (shift-DEL). Just type <alt-*>r<control-a><shift-DEL>. Makes use of
# the fact that the people who implemented this wacky emulator are just
# printing characters to the default display driver, and fetching
# characters from default input (the reason you can't produce a
# control-t to do the "twiddle" command in Emacs).

# 
# The Xitex SCT-100 was a single-card terminal kit (supply your own
# keyboard and video monitor), available either with or without all the
# required components.  It came with a very nice assembly and operations
# manual.  It offered a resolution of 64 by 16 characters, and handled
# ASCII at 110 or 300 baud and Baudot at 45.45 or 74.2 baud over RS-232,
# 20 mA or 60 mA current loop.

# My manual (Copyright 1977) lists the manufacturer as Xitex Corp, 13628

# 
# I remember this terminal fondly, because I used it (briefly) on the
# first real computer I built:  a Z-80 CP/M machine.  I even got my
# favorite full-screen editor to run on it, though it was a bit comical at

# This is a preliminary TERMCAP for VIDTEX, a terminal program sold by 
# Compuserve.  Line and column numbers are computer-dependent (I have a
# Commodore '64); you should use the meta-B option to shut off clean-breaking
# of lines.  No key codes included since some of them are programmable and
# most are machine-specific.  Works on vi if you don't use clean-breaking.
# Very similar to the IBM 3101 termcap.  Escape-D used for backspace because
# control-H is destructive backspace.  There seem to be a few weirdnesses
# (especially at the beginning of a wrapped line), and the cursor does not,
# unfortunately, flash.

# The entries in this file have been so thoroughly orphaned by time and
# circumstance that I have elected to remove them from the terminfo termcap.
#
# In most cases, this is because the entries (and any associated comments)
# seem to hold out no hope that the target terminal will ever be identified
# (and I've tried, on comp.terminals, for each of these, many times).
#
# In a few cases, these are custom or homebrew designs that have obviously
# been obsolete for more than a decade.
#
# Entries for obsolete hardware with less than a 80x24 screen size 
# have also been gathered here.  This includes daisy-wheel printers.
#
# Finally, entries that were in the main file classically but don't appear to
# convey any information have been gathered here.  Many of these have the
# -na suffix.
#
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with 
# the string "########") and minor sections (beginning with "####"); do
#
#	grep "^####" <file> | more

#### Amstrad
#

# Russell Marks <rus@forfree.at> writes on 10 Jul 1999 21:40:52:
# ZCN, my CP/M-like OS for the Amstrad NC100, uses a terminal emulation
# on its console that might be generously called `unique', not least
# because it doesn't actually emulate anything. :-)
#
# The Amstrad NC100 was an A4-sized Z80 portable produced in the early
# 1990s (from roughly 1992 to 1994 I think), and was touted as a `user
# friendly' machine (it was advertised on TV as such). It wasn't exactly
# a great success, though Amstrad produced a followup `NC200', so
# presumably it didn't flop *that* badly.
#
# ZCN is, of course, not at all user-friendly. :-) (To be fair I
# recently wrote a graphical front-end for it, but it's still CP/M-ish
# at heart.) I wrote it mainly because I liked the idea of a portable
# CP/M box, but also because I was rather annoyed at how inextensible
# and limiting the built-in software was. I uploaded ZCN 0.1 in 1994;
# [1.2 came out in mid-1999].
# As for live/dead/OOTB status, Amstrad seem to be OOTB (the 8-bit
# computer business, that is), and I *think* the company as a whole may
# now be dead, but I'm not sure. They released a 16MHz Z80-based `PcW16'
# [sic] a couple of years ago which (AIUI) was rather like a desktop
# version of the NC200 (it was incompatible with their previous
# CP/M-based PCW/PcW machines), but I'm pretty sure that was the last
# one. Arnor, who wrote the NC100's ROM software - which was largely
# built around a hacked-up copy of Protext - are dead. I'd say ZCN
# itself is live - I still hack on it from time to time, and still use
# my ZCN box on a daily basis (if only for minor stuff like noting
# things down).
# 
# Anyway, the control codes used by the ZCN console evolved in a pretty
# ad-hoc manner, as is probably obvious from looking at them. For some
# reason I was (in 1994) rather taken with the idea that all the codes
# should be single-character ones, but didn't see the point in emulating
# an existing terminal like an ADM3A, and the rest is history. Sigh. :-)
# 
# In terms of popularity, it's a fair bet that ZCN is about as obscure
# as they come. (This is the main reason I've not sent an entry before;
# for all I know, I may be the only person anywhere using the ZCN
# console as a terminal!) I've only had correspondence from something
# like 5 or 6 people about ZCN, and only one of those was about using
# ZCN as a terminal.
# 
# Probably the only interesting feature about the ZCN console itself is
# the unusual screen size - 480x64 in pixels, meaning 120x10 in the 4x6
# chars ZCN uses. Oh, and also the NC100's keyboard is somewhat
# notorious for having a few brightly-coloured keys, which the ROM apps
# refer to (e.g. "To use the WORD PROCESSOR  Press YELLOW & RED") - the
# `Function' modifier key is yellow, cursor-left red, cursor-right
# green, and cursor-down blue.
# 
# A few other random keyboard notes, while I'm at it. There's a `Menu'
# key, but since the keyboard has no backquote key, ZCN uses it for
# that. There are three modifier keys (apart from shift) - Function,
# Control, and Symbol. ZCN uses Function, which is at the bottom-left of
# the keyboard, as an extra control key (the real Control is absurd,
# being normal-key-sized and below `Z'), and Symbol as Meta.

# modem, for the Commodore 128. It does insert-character and
# delete-character. However, to get the insert-character, you must use
# alt-* to remap control-A on receive into the INSERT character
# (shift-DEL). Just type <alt-*>r<control-a><shift-DEL>. Makes use of
# the fact that the people who implemented this wacky emulator are just
# printing characters to the default display driver, and fetching
# characters from default input (the reason you can't produce a
# control-t to do the "twiddle" command in Emacs).

# David Querbach <querbach@stargate.ca> tells us:
#
# I truly hope that I'm not the only person left on earth that knows this
# terminal.  I may, however, be the only one who still has one in working
# condition.
# 
# The Xitex SCT-100 was a single-card terminal kit (supply your own
# keyboard and video monitor), available either with or without all the
# required components.  It came with a very nice assembly and operations
# manual.  It offered a resolution of 64 by 16 characters, and handled
# ASCII at 110 or 300 baud and Baudot at 45.45 or 74.2 baud over RS-232,
# 20 mA or 60 mA current loop.
#
# My manual (Copyright 1977) lists the manufacturer as Xitex Corp, 13628
# Neutron, P.O. Box 402110, Dallas, Texas, 75240.  Phone (214) 386-3859.
# 
# I remember this terminal fondly, because I used it (briefly) on the
# first real computer I built:  a Z-80 CP/M machine.  I even got my
# favorite full-screen editor to run on it, though it was a bit comical at
# 300 baud.

# From: Joel Rubin <jmrubin@coral.berkeley.edu>
# This is a preliminary TERMCAP for VIDTEX, a terminal program sold by 
# Compuserve.  Line and column numbers are computer-dependent (I have a
# Commodore '64); you should use the meta-B option to shut off clean-breaking
# of lines.  No key codes included since some of them are programmable and
# most are machine-specific.  Works on vi if you don't use clean-breaking.
# Very similar to the IBM 3101 termcap.  Escape-D used for backspace because
# control-H is destructive backspace.  There seem to be a few weirdnesses
# (especially at the beginning of a wrapped line), and the cursor does not,
# unfortunately, flash.

# The entries in this file have been so thoroughly orphaned by time and
# circumstance that I have elected to remove them from the terminfo termcap.
#
# In most cases, this is because the entries (and any associated comments)
# seem to hold out no hope that the target terminal will ever be identified
# (and I've tried, on comp.terminals, for each of these, many times).
#
# In a few cases, these are custom or homebrew designs that have obviously
# been obsolete for more than a decade.
#
# Entries for obsolete hardware with less than a 80x24 screen size 
# have also been gathered here.  This includes daisy-wheel printers.
#
# Finally, entries that were in the main file classically but don't appear to
# convey any information have been gathered here.  Many of these have the
# -na suffix.
#
#	-na	No arrow keys - termcap ignores arrow keys which are
#		actually there on the terminal, so the user can use
#		the arrow keys locally.
#
# Comments in this file begin with # - they cannot appear in the middle
# of a terminfo/termcap entry.  Individual capabilities are commented out by
# placing a period between the colon and the capability name.
#
# The file is divided up into major sections (headed by lines beginning with

#### Amstrad
#

# Russell Marks <rus@forfree.at> writes on 10 Jul 1999 21:40:52:
# ZCN, my CP/M-like OS for the Amstrad NC100, uses a terminal emulation
# on its console that might be generously called `unique', not least
# because it doesn't actually emulate anything. :-)
#
# The Amstrad NC100 was an A4-sized Z80 portable produced in the early
# 1990s (from roughly 1992 to 1994 I think), and was touted as a `user
# friendly' machine (it was advertised on TV as such). It wasn't exactly
# a great success, though Amstrad produced a followup `NC200', so
# presumably it didn't flop *that* badly.
#
# ZCN is, of course, not at all user-friendly. :-) (To be fair I
# recently wrote a graphical front-end for it, but it's still CP/M-ish
# at heart.) I wrote it mainly because I liked the idea of a portable
# CP/M box, but also because I was rather annoyed at how inextensible
# and limiting the built-in software was. I uploaded ZCN 0.1 in 1994;
# [1.2 came out in mid-1999].
# As for live/dead/OOTB status, Amstrad seem to be OOTB (the 8-bit
# computer business, that is), and I *think* the company as a whole may
# now be dead, but I'm not sure. They released a 16MHz Z80-based `PcW16'
# [sic] a couple of years ago which (AIUI) was rather like a desktop
# version of the NC200 (it was incompatible with their previous
# CP/M-based PCW/PcW machines), but I'm pretty sure that was the last
# one. Arnor, who wrote the NC100's ROM software - which was largely
# built around a hacked-up copy of Protext - are dead. I'd say ZCN
# itself is live - I still hack on it from time to time, and still use
# my ZCN box on a daily basis (if only for minor stuff like noting
# things down).
# 
# Anyway, the control codes used by the ZCN console evolved in a pretty
# ad-hoc manner, as is probably obvious from looking at them. For some
# reason I was (in 1994) rather taken with the idea that all the codes
# should be single-character ones, but didn't see the point in emulating
# an existing terminal like an ADM3A, and the rest is history. Sigh. :-)
# 
# In terms of popularity, it's a fair bet that ZCN is about as obscure
# as they come. (This is the main reason I've not sent an entry before;
# for all I know, I may be the only person anywhere using the ZCN
# console as a terminal!) I've only had correspondence from something
# like 5 or 6 people about ZCN, and only one of those was about using
# ZCN as a terminal.
# 
# Probably the only interesting feature about the ZCN console itself is
# the unusual screen size - 480x64 in pixels, meaning 120x10 in the 4x6
# chars ZCN uses. Oh, and also the NC100's keyboard is somewhat
# notorious for having a few brightly-coloured keys, which the ROM apps
# refer to (e.g. "To use the WORD PROCESSOR  Press YELLOW & RED") - the
# `Function' modifier key is yellow, cursor-left red, cursor-right
# green, and cursor-down blue.
# 
# A few other random keyboard notes, while I'm at it. There's a `Menu'
# key, but since the keyboard has no backquote key, ZCN uses it for
# that. There are three modifier keys (apart from shift) - Function,
# Control, and Symbol. ZCN uses Function, which is at the bottom-left of
# the keyboard, as an extra control key (the real Control is absurd,
# being normal-key-sized and below `Z'), and Symbol as Meta.

# This is a termcap for the VT100 emulator that comes with the 1670
# modem, for the Commodore 128. It does insert-character and
# delete-character. However, to get the insert-character, you must use
# alt-* to remap control-A on receive into the INSERT character
# (shift-DEL). Just type <alt-*>r<control-a><shift-DEL>. Makes use of
# the fact that the people who implemented this wacky emulator are just
# printing characters to the default display driver, and fetching
# characters from default input (the reason you can't produce a

# David Querbach <querbach@stargate.ca> tells us:
#
# I truly hope that I'm not the only person left on earth that knows this
# terminal.  I may, however, be the only one who still has one in working
# condition.
# 
# The Xitex SCT-100 was a single-card terminal kit (supply your own
# keyboard and video monitor), available either with or without all the
# required components.  It came with a very nice assembly and operations
# manual.  It offered a resolution of 64 by 16 characters, and handled
# ASCII at 110 or 300 baud and Baudot at 45.45 or 74.2 baud over RS-232,
# 20 mA or 60 mA current loop.
#
# My manual (Copyright 1977) lists the manufacturer as Xitex Corp, 13628
# Neutron, P.O. Box 402110, Dallas, Texas, 75240.  Phone (214) 386-3859.
# 
# I remember this terminal fondly, because I used it (briefly) on the
# first real computer I built:  a Z-80 CP/M machine.  I even got my
# favorite full-screen editor to run on it, though it was a bit comical at
# 300 baud.

# From: Joel Rubin <jmrubin@coral.berkeley.edu>
# This is a preliminary TERMCAP for VIDTEX, a terminal program sold by 
# Compuserve.  Line and column numbers are computer-dependent (I have a
# Commodore '64); you should use the meta-B option to shut off clean-breaking
# of lines.  No key codes included since some of them are programmable and
# most are machine-specific.  Works on vi if you don't use clean-breaking.
# Very similar to the IBM 3101 termcap.  Escape-D used for backspace because
# control-H is destructive backspace.  There seem to be a few weirdnesses
# (especially at the beginning of a wrapped line), and the cursor does not,
# unfortunately, flash.

# This entry turned out to be only trivially different from DEC's terminfo.

# DEC VT100 with Advanced Video Option -- NOT DEC'S ENTRY!!!
# This may be used as an alternate vt102 entry; it's probably better than the
# stock one if you can live with XON/XOFF.  All the AVO gave you was smul/rmul.
# From: Doug Gwyn <gwyn@smoke.brl.mil> 25 Jan 93
# Hardware tabs are assumed to be set every 8 columns; they can be set up
# by the "reset", "tset", or "tabs" utilities (use vt100-x, 132 columns, for
# this).  I have included some compatible code in "rs" for the VT640 if you
# have one.  No delays are specified; use "stty ixon -ixany" to enable DC3/DC1
# flow control!
# Thanks to elsie!ado (Arthur David Olson) for numerous improvements.
